    description: "React hooks allows us to take a Reactjs functional component and add state and lifecycle methods to it. In simple words, React hooks are special functions to extend the capabilities of functional components and give them the possibility to have lifecycle events and manage state",

    description: "Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.",

    title: "React Lifting State Up",
    description: "There should be a single “source of truth” for any data that changes in a React application. Usually, the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. Then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor. Instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the top-down data flow.",

    title: "What is Material-ui",
    description: "Material-UI is a library that provides React components for easy and fast web development. We can easily put together really aesthetic and functional components and make it work according to our use as all the components are configurable. This saves a lot of time as we don’t have to struggle with CSS to make things presentable. Material-UI components work in isolation.",
